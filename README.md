This repository contains a collection of Playwright tests written in TypeScript, based on various open-source websites. The goal is to demonstrate best practices in test setup and implementation.

The primary purpose of this code is for my personal learning and experimentation. However, I am sharing it here in the hope that others may find these examples useful.
